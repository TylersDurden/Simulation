## Week 0
First attempts with genetic algorithms. Doing random walks and
using evolution to minimize the distance to a goal, starting with
random walks.

## Week 1
Same thing as last week, but improving the search implementation
by doing more careful pruning and changing the way fitness is 
evaluated.
